            My name is Emma Drapp! I'm an HCDE major and passionate about thoughtful design. I am passionate about film/media (my favorite film from 2022 was Barbarian!), trying new things, and dogs :)

                  <img src="IMG_5067 Large.jpeg" width=250></a>
                <p>
		Assignment 1 was to create a schematic for at least 3 LEDs connected to an Arduino, which will implement as a circuit on a breadboard. Additionally, I wrote firmware for the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern.

                <p>
		Assignment 2 was to create a circuit with multiple LEDs and a button where at least one LED fades along side a schematic of it.

                  <p>
          Assignment 3 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a photoresistor in a voltage divider to change the state of an output device.

                  <p>
          Assignment 4 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses parts from your kit that require a library (Remote) and includes both an input part (IR sensor) and an output part (seven segment display). 
                  </p>

                  <p>
          Assignment 5 was to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to control load power separate from logic power.
